The base code for the django is mostly done ig. The rest will be completed as we make the pages.
So it will be easier to test

So this is how I imagine the workflow to be.
in the main folder, there shall be a subfolder for the HTML pages, CSS and images vakin.
You and I will be designing and making the pages in these folders. And then I will copy the pages to the django app for testing and such.
This way we can use live server for development and don't have to worry about weird file naming.

I will be working on the news page next. I want to get the database structure of that down.
